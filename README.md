Coding is a hobby. Fan of Emacs and Lisp languages.

I'm currently organizing and tidying up my project repositories.

I have already published my full and actual [Emacs configuration (init.el file)](https://github.com/occisn/emacs-config).

I am currently consolidating [Common Lisp utilities](https://github.com/occisn/cl-utils).

[Converter](https://github.com/occisn/cl-lisp2calc) from Common Lisp to GNU Calc (to be reviewed later)

Common Lisp : [performance study](https://github.com/occisn/cl-speed-relative-performance) (to be reviewed later)

Some problem solving in [Emacs Lisp](https://github.com/occisn/elisp-problem-solving) (to be enriched), [Common Lisp](https://github.com/occisn/cl-problem-solving) (to be enriched), [spreadsheets](https://github.com/occisn/spreadsheet-problem-solving) (stabilized), [GNU Calc](https://github.com/occisn/calc-problem-solving) (stabilized).

Utils for [Emacs](https://github.com/occisn/emacs-utils), [Emacs Lisp](https://github.com/occisn/elisp-utils) and [Common Lisp](https://github.com/occisn/cl-utils).
